## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is a program in our computer that allows to use a command to not only save our work, but 
let others work on it as well.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the actual program, where as GitHub is a software that allows us to upload our code 
to a cloud. In this cloud others can access and copy our code
3. Why do we create a branch?
We create a branch for our own specific feature or code. For example if we were tasked with 
fixing a bug, we'd fix the bug on our own branch and send it back to the main once all edits 
had been completed
 4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
A pull request is when you want to upload your work to the main branch, usually a team lead 
or supervisor would approve it/check it off before they added it in.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working 
on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
git checkout 'Branch-Name'
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git 'fetch': This command will input the changes that have been made on the remote repos 
into the current branch
git 'merge': This command merges all named branches into the current branch that you're in
git 'pull': This command pulls the changes from the remote repository or a local branch into 
your current branch 
7. What is a merge conflict?
It is when code that gets pushed from a branch into the remote repository goes straight into 
the main branch, because they have been merged when it isn't necessary
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
By branching the repository, and allowing your seniors to check off code rather than 
immediately merging it.
